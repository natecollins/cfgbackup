# BACKUP_TYPE=rotation
BACKUP_TYPE=

# Maximum number of backups to create if BACKUP_TYPE is rotation
# Ignored if BACKUP_TYPE isn't rotation
# - When rotating old backups, the backup that is MAX_ROTATIONS old (by dir name)
#   will be reused for the next backups, even if there are older backups present
MAX_ROTATIONS=8

# Hard link files that have not changed between rotation backups,
# greatly reducing disk usage.
ROTATIONALS_HARD_LINK=0

# Hard link identical files within a single backup, requires command: hardlink
# This is a post-transfer process and can significantly lengthen job
# runtime; all files will initally be copied to target dir and hardlinked after.
# Set to 1 to hard link files with matching content and permissions/owner/timestamp.
# Set to 2 to hard link files with matching content even when metadata differs.
# Ignored if JOB_TYPE is mirror
IDENTICALS_HARD_LINK=0

# Rotation only subdirectory name; requires rotation key of: NUM0, NUM1, or DATE
# backup_NUM0 = numeric increment starting with 0
# rotation-NUM1 = numeric increment starting with 1

# The NUM keys can be zero padded, such as NUM00 or NUM0001

# LOG_DIR=/path/to/logs/
LOG_DIR=

# Allow backups to delete files from target directory when missing from source; default of 1
# - If set to 0, any deleted files will be reported in logs and
#   email, but not removed from target dir
# - If set to 1, this sets the rsync flag: --del
# - If set to empty string (no value), then missing files will not be reported and no rsync flags are set
ALLOW_DELETIONS=1

# Allow files to be overwritten in the target directory when differing from source; default of 1
# - If set to 0, any changed files will be reported in logs and email,
#   but will not change files in existing target dir; sets the rsync flag: --ignore-existing
# - If set to 1 (or empty string), then changed files will be not be reported and no rsync flags are set
ALLOW_OVERWRITES=1

# Mirror jobs only. If a file is deleted on one end and updated on the other end
# between runs, this setting indicates the action to take; default is update
# Values allowed are: update,delete
# - update: restore deleted file with updated version
# - delete: delete updated file, losing any changes
#MIRROR_CONFLICT_ACTION=update
