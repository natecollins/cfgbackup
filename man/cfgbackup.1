.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.B cfgbackup
[CONFIG_FILE] [COMMAND]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
cfgbackup creates backups of a directory given a config file specifying
how the backup should be run. Each backup job uses a separate config
file. See provided example.conf file as a template to use for
setting up a config file. Scheduling of backups should be handled
by cron.

.SH "COMMANDS"
.TP
.B check
Perform a verification of the config file and check
that access to the source and target directories exist.
.TP
.B status
Print out the current status of any current job for the
given config. If no job is running, reports on the last
job that ran.
.TP
.B list
List rotational backup subdirectories for the given conf.
.TP
.B run
Run the backup according to the config file provided.
.TP
.B reset
Resets partially completed or failed backups. This will
abort a currently running backup.
